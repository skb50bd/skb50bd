    "summary": "Senior Software & Systems Engineer with 5+ years of enterprise experience building secure, reliable, and highly automated platforms. I ship backend systems in .NET, design and operate Kubernetes-based infrastructure, and automate with clean IaC and reliable CI/CD. Comfortable deep in incident response, performance profiling, and network/security hardening—then turning those lessons into simpler architectures, stronger runbooks, and observable systems. I take ownership end-to-end (design → build → operate) and optimize for reliability, performance, and long-term maintainability.",
